## Project Structure

The application has been refactored into separate modules for better organization:

  - Initializes flight data (20 hardcoded flights)
  - Starts the console UI

- **`flights.py`** - Flight-related classes
  - `Flight` (abstract base class)
  - `NormalFlight` (standard flights)
  - `RedEyeFlight` (discounted night flights)

- **`categories.py`** - Booking category classes
  - `BookingCategory` (abstract base class)
  - `FirstClass` (F1-F10, 3x multiplier)
  - `Business` (B11-B30, 2x multiplier)
  - `Economy` (E31-E60, 1x multiplier)

- **`booking.py`** - Booking management
  - `Booking` (individual booking records)
  - `BookingSystem` (manages flights and bookings)

- **`ui.py`** - User interface
  - `ConsoleUI` (menu system and user interactions)

## üöÄ How to Run
